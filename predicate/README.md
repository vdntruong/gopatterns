# Predicate Pattern

In Go, the Predicate Pattern involves using functions that take one or more arguments and return a boolean value, indicating whether a certain condition is met. 
These functions are known as "predicates." The pattern is commonly used for filtering collections, validating data, or implementing conditional logic in a concise and expressive manner.
