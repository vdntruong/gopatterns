# Option

The Functional Options Pattern, often referred to simply as the Options Pattern, is a design pattern in Go used to handle optional parameters in functions or constructors, particularly for creating or configuring complex structs. 

It provides a flexible and extensible way to manage configuration without resorting to a large number of parameters in a function signature or a single, monolithic configuration struct.
